Welcome to Chronolock - the revolutionary Web3 platform that lets you create time-locked digital treasures on the Internet Computer. Let me start with this beautiful hero slider showcasing our key features and visual elements. As we scroll down, here are some fascinating fun facts about our platform - notice these statistics showing our growing ecosystem and user engagement. Now let's look at our 'About Us' section where you can see how we use cutting-edge vetKD cryptography and blockchain technology to ensure your content remains mathematically secure until the exact moment you specify. Here's our comprehensive guide to create your first Chronolock - a step-by-step walkthrough that makes the process intuitive for everyone. This collection section gives you a preview of existing Chronolocks, and clicking here will redirect you to our full collection page where you can explore all time-locked treasures. Finally, let me show you our roadmap outlining exciting future features, and our FAQ section that answers all the common questions about time-locked NFTs and our cryptographic approach.
Let's start by connecting to the platform. I'll click this Connect button in the header. Notice how Chronolock uses Internet Identity - this is Web3 native authentication at its finest. No emails, no passwords, no personal data stored anywhere. Just pure cryptographic key-based security. Watch as the Internet Identity flow opens - this creates a unique cryptographic identity tied to your device. Once I complete this authentication process, you'll see my user menu appear showing my wallet address and CRNL token balance. This passwordless system ensures maximum security while providing seamless user experience.
Perfect! Let me open this user menu to show you something exciting. Upon first login, users automatically receive 200 CRNL tokens - you can see my balance right here. CRNL is the platform's native currency, but here's where it gets really interesting - Chronolock has a built-in referral system that rewards community growth. Look at this unique referral code that was automatically generated for me. Let me copy this referral link - when someone uses this link to join Chronolock, I earn 20 CRNL as a referral reward. These CRNL tokens are essential for creating media Chronolocks, which cost 20 CRNL each. Notice this Send Tokens functionality too - this enables peer-to-peer transactions within our ecosystem, making CRNL a truly functional utility token.
Now let's create our first Chronolock. I'll navigate to the Create page where you'll see the process is intuitive but incredibly powerful. We're going to create a time-locked Chronolock that can only be opened in the future.
First! the time-lock magic! I'm setting the unlock date and time - let's say for 10 minutes from now. Watch this recipient selection - I can skip to add any recipients to make it 'Public', meaning anyone can decrypt after the unlock time, or add specific Principal IDs of users who can decrypt this content to make it 'Private' for specific users only. Let's add my principal id so that only I can decrypt the content!
Next, I'll show you this elegant file upload interface. I'm uploading a sample image that will be encrypted and time-locked. Don't forget when you select a file you need to press upload button to add it to the Chronolock content. Ok after uploading the file I press next!
Now I'm filling in the essential details - the Name 'My first Time Capsule', a Description 'A special message for future me', and this Title that will be visible before unlock: 'ðŸ”’ Locked for me'. Notice how I can add custom attributes like 'Occasion: Demo' and 'Mood: Hopeful' - these become part of the encrypted metadata that gets stored on-chain.
Perfect! Now let's review everything in this summary. You can see all our details, the unlock time, and here's the cost breakdown - 20 CRNL for this media Chronolock. When I click 'Create Chronolock', watch the magic happen - our content gets encrypted using AES-256-GCM, the time-lock gets enforced by vetKD (Verifiable Encrypted Threshold Key Derivation), and an ICRC-7 compliant NFT gets minted. The transaction is processing... and there's our success message with the unique ID! The metadata is now stored on-chain while the encrypted content is distributed securely. Let me show you our newly created Chronolock now appearing in our collection.
Now let's explore our Chronolock collection. I'll navigate to the Collection page where you can see all our created time-locks with their current status. Look at these beautiful Chronolock cards - here's our newly created one with its visual countdown timer showing exactly when it unlocks. Notice these different status indicators: locked Chronolocks display countdown timers, while unlocked ones show they're ready to decrypt. You can see different types too - some are mentioned not available to you which you are not among the recipients while some others mentioned the chronolock is available to you and some others.
Here's the magic moment - when a Chronolock reaches its unlock time and is available to you! I'm opening this unlocked Chronolock and clicking 'Decrypt Content'. Watch this fascinating decryption process unfold - first it's 'Preparing decryption', now 'Getting VetKD public key' from our canister, then 'Requesting decryption key' using the cryptographic proof that the time has arrived. See it 'Decrypting with VetKD' - this is the mathematical guarantee that content cannot be decrypted before the unlock time, not even by us platform operators! Now it's 'Downloading and decrypting media' and... there it is! The original image is revealed along with all the metadata and attributes we encrypted. Notice this download functionality - users can save their decrypted content. This entire process is only happening in my browser window and provides cryptographic proof of time-lock integrity using vetKD technology.
Ok let's look in to the token transfer functionality. The CRNL token system enables seamless peer-to-peer transactions within our ecosystem. Let me show you how easy it is to send tokens to another user. I'll click 'Send Tokens' in the header, and this clean modal appears. Now I'm entering the recipient's Principal ID - this is their cryptographic wallet address. I'll send 50 CRNL tokens. Notice the transparent transaction fee of just 0.0001 CRNL - incredibly low costs thanks to the Internet Computer's efficiency. When I confirm and send this transaction, you can see our updated balance immediately reflecting the transfer. This makes CRNL perfect for microtransactions and community rewards.
Let's quickly demonstrate the referral system in action with a fresh user. First check my current balance and I copy my referral link and opening a second browser window and visiting the link we copied. Now I'll connect with a different Internet Identity to simulate a new user joining through my referral. Perfect! Watch as this new user automatically receives their 200 CRNL welcome bonus. Now let me switch back to my original account - and there it is! I've received my 20 CRNL referral reward. This gamified approach to community growth makes Chronolock naturally viral while rewarding early adopters.
You can now see that Chronolock truly represents the future of temporal digital ownership. We've seamlessly combined NFTs, advanced vetKD cryptography, and mathematically enforced time-locks in an intuitive Web3 experience. Built on the Internet Computer with high-performance smart contracts and a beautiful interface, it's both technically sophisticated and user-friendly. The platform opens up endless possibilities: time-locked wills for inheritance, birthday surprises that unlock exactly on time, investment strategy reveals, educational content releases, or artistic expressions that unfold over time. This is just the beginning of temporal digital ownership.
