> "Perfect! Let me open this user menu to show you something exciting. Upon first login, users automatically receive 200 CRNL tokens - you can see my balance right here. CRNL is the platform's native currency, but here's where it gets really interesting - Chronolock has a built-in referral system that rewards community growth. Look at this unique referral code that was automatically generated for me. Let me copy this referral link - when someone uses this link to join Chronolock, I earn 20 CRNL as a referral reward. These CRNL tokens are essential for creating media Chronolocks, which cost 20 CRNL each. Notice this Send Tokens functionality too - this enables peer-to-peer transactions within our ecosystem, making CRNL a truly functional utility token."

#### **Step 1: Unlock Time & Recipients (2:15 - 2:45)**
**Narration:**
> "First! the time-lock magic! I'm setting the unlock date and time - let's say for 10 minutes from now. Watch this recipient selection - I can skip to add any recipients to make it 'Public', meaning anyone can decrypt after the unlock time, or add specific Principal IDs of users who can decrypt this content to make it 'Private' for specific users only. Let's add my principal id so that only I can decrypt the content!"

**Actions:**
1. Set unlock date/time
2. Show recipient options:
   - Public (anyone can decrypt after unlock time)
   - Private (specific users only)
3. Add recipient Principal IDs


#### **Step 2: Upload & Details (1:45 - 2:15)**
**Narration:**
> "Next, I'll show you this elegant file upload interface. I'm uploading a sample image that will be encrypted and time-locked. Don't forget when you select a file you need to press upload button to add it to the Chronolock content. Ok after uploading the file I press next!
Now I'm filling in the essential details - the Name 'My first Time Capsule', a Description 'A special message for future me', and this Title that will be visible before unlock: 'ðŸ”’ Locked for me'. Notice how I can add custom attributes like 'Occasion: Demo' and 'Mood: Hopeful' - these become part of the encrypted metadata that gets stored on-chain."

**Actions:**
1. Show file upload interface
2. Upload a sample image/video
3. Fill in the details form:
   - Name: "My Time Capsule"
   - Description: "A special message for future me"
   - Title: "ðŸ”’ Locked for me"
   - Add custom attributes (e.g., "Occasion": "New Year", "Mood": "Hopeful")



#### **Step 3: Review & Create (2:45 - 3:30)**
**Narration:**
> "Perfect! Now let's review everything in this summary. You can see all our details, the unlock time, and here's the cost breakdown - 20 CRNL for this media Chronolock. When I click 'Create Chronolock', watch the magic happen - our content gets encrypted using AES-256-GCM, the time-lock gets enforced by vetKD (Verifiable Encrypted Threshold Key Derivation), and an ICRC-7 compliant NFT gets minted. The transaction is processing... and there's our success message with the unique ID! The metadata is now stored on-chain while the encrypted content is distributed securely. Let me show you our newly created Chronolock now appearing in our collection."

**Actions:**
1. Review all details in summary
2. Show cost breakdown (20 CRNL for media Chronolock)
3. Click "Create Chronolock"

**Narration:**
> "Now let's explore our Chronolock collection. I'll navigate to the Collection page where you can see all our created time-locks with their current status. Look at these beautiful Chronolock cards - here's our newly created one with its visual countdown timer showing exactly when it unlocks. Notice these different status indicators: locked Chronolocks display countdown timers, while unlocked ones show they're ready to decrypt. You can see different types too - some are mentioned not available to you which you are not among the recipients while some others mentioned the chronolock is available to you and some others."

**Actions:**
1. Navigate to Collection page
2. Show different Chronolock cards:
   - Locked Chronolocks (with countdown timers)

### **DECRYPTION EXPERIENCE (4:15 - 5:00)**

**[Focus: Unlock and decrypt process]**

**Narration:**
> "Here's the magic moment - when a Chronolock reaches its unlock time and is available to you! I'm opening this unlocked Chronolock and clicking 'Decrypt Content'. Watch this fascinating decryption process unfold - first it's 'Preparing decryption', now 'Getting VetKD public key' from our canister, then 'Requesting decryption key' using the cryptographic proof that the time has arrived. See it 'Decrypting with VetKD' - this is the mathematical guarantee that content cannot be decrypted before the unlock time, not even by us platform operators! Now it's 'Downloading and decrypting media' and... there it is! The original image is revealed along with all the metadata and attributes we encrypted. Notice this download functionality - users can save their decrypted content. This entire process is only happening in my browser window and provides cryptographic proof of time-lock integrity using vetKD technology."

**Actions:**
1. Open an unlocked Chronolock
2. Click "Decrypt Content" button
3. Show the decryption process:
   - "Preparing decryption..."

Let me show you how easy it is to send tokens to another user. I'll click 'Send Tokens' in the header, and this clean modal appears. Now I'm entering the recipient's Principal ID - this is their cryptographic wallet address. I'll send 50 CRNL tokens. Notice the transparent transaction fee of just 0.0001 CRNL - incredibly low costs thanks to the Internet Computer's efficiency. When I confirm and send this transaction, you can see our updated balance immediately reflecting the transfer. This makes CRNL perfect for microtransactions and community rewards."

First check my current balance and I copy my referral link and opening a second browser window and visiting the link we copied. Now I'll connect with a different Internet Identity to simulate a new user joining through my referral. Perfect! Watch as this new user automatically receives their 200 CRNL welcome bonus.
